# A Quote from Dan Abromov

> "Things that are traditionally sync don’t have to “feel” sync. Things that are traditionally async don’t have to “feel” async. Be intentional and bridge the gap when you need."

### Tech

- [ReactJS] - Frontend Library for awesome apps!
- [Material UI] - Beautiful icons

Also;
This project uses new React Context API with the useReducer hook ! DAMN LOVE IT.
